        "lyrics": "[00:08.13]Hello everyone, and welcome to Cazilor\n[00:12.58]Cazilor is a fantasy land, home to many humans, whose mere existence sparks great controversy\n[00:20.63]You see, Cazilor sits between two factions of giants\n[00:26.24]The faction to the East, ruled by Toltag, believes that humans within Cazilor deserve to be exterminated\n[00:34.24]Meanwhile, the faction to the West, ruled by Ginsi, believes that humans should be treated as equals\n[00:41.73]This debate was enough to cause war\n[00:44.09]Toltag sends giants to destroy homes and murder innocents\n[00:48.90]Ginsi sends giants to protect them\n[00:51.99]This battle has waged on for as long as anyone can remember\n[00:56.87]Eventually, the humans of Cazilor expressed to Ginsi that they did not wish to simply stand by and be slaughtered\n[01:05.56]Many wished to join the fight\n[01:07.53]So, Ginsi created an elite army known as The Mazmus\n[01:13.25]It utilized the combined power of humans and giants to fight against Toltag\n[01:19.04]During the two years of training it takes to join The Mazmus, recruits are, of course, taught how to slay giants\n[01:27.32]This includes: learning how to ride horses, use special gear, learn battle strategies, and some even have magical powers awakened inside of them\n[01:37.47]They also get told to scrub toilets and pick up horse shit. It builds character!\n[01:43.08]As a matter of fact, one of these character building exercises is happening right now\n[01:49.01]Sitting in a field is our brave recruit, Apollo, and his hard-headed squadmate, Arthur\n[01:55.85]They are being supervised by their captain, while they stand guard on night watch\n[02:01.01]I wonder what they're talking about down there\n[02:05.08]\n[02:15.48]\"OK, I'll break the ice if nobody else will. Hey, Arthur. Tell me your... fondest memory.\"\n[02:23.27]\"I have none.\"\n[02:24.37]\"Oh, OK. So we're telling lies. Cool. So I have three legs, 14 toes, which means I'm missing a toe on just one leg and my name is actually Kyle. Heh-heh. C'mon, dude, spill. I know you have a fond memory in there somewhere.\"\n[02:37.07]\"Whether I do or don't doesn't matter. Currently, we're in charge of the night watch. It's our job to protect the citizens of Cazilor.\"\n[02:46.13]\"Oh, brother. Dude. We are in a field outside of Opulo. I think we're about as far away from Toltag as we can possibly be.\"\n[02:58.71]\"We still have a duty to uphold.\"\n[03:00.63]\"Oh, my God, OK. I'm done talking to you, I'm done. Uh, what about you, Captain? You've been in the The Mazmus for, ever. Got any fond memories left in that head of yours?\"\n[03:10.31]\"Hmm... Fond memories, huh?\"\n[03:13.02]\"Yeah, like a moment in your past that you can't help but smile when you think about it, y'know?\"\n[03:17.84]\"Probably the day my ex-wife died.\"\n[03:20.94]\"Sorry, what? Captain, that's a fond memory for you?\"\n[03:25.24]\"It might just be my favorite one.\"\n[03:26.32]",
